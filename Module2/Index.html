		<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"><p class="p1">Rugby is a men's game. Popular leagues around the world are SuperRugby, Gallgher Premiership, Top14 and Pro14. Although, the Japan Top League seems to be attracting a larger viewership each year. The Rugby World Cup takes place each year and the current champion is South Africa's Springboks.<span id="s1">Rugby</span></p></div>

		<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"><p class="p2">They say Cricket is a gentlemen's game. Its lack of contact makes it innocuous, although there are several ways through which one may be hurt. Indian Premier League, Big Bash League, T20 Blast are widely followed competitions. The Test match version of the game seems to be the most prominent of the all.<span id="s2">Cricket</span></p></div>

		<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12"><p class="p3">For the affluent, so it is said, F1 is good entertainment. A lot of investment has gone into it, from the drivers to team staff to the circuits themselves. Funny that the sport is said to be global but there is not a single circuit in Africa. Spa, Hockenheim, Silverstone and Suzuka are circuits in Belgium, Germany, UK and Japan.<span id="s3">Formula 1</span></p></div>
